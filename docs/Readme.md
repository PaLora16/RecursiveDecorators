# Recursive decorators
Let's suppose we want an object whose behavior depends on run-time conditions. A similar concept to dynamic polymorphism in Java, but for Python classes. Using decorator pattern allows augmenting functionality of  parent class. By devising a method for chaining decorators, we can construct objects whose behavior is composed of the functionality added by decorators. A possible solution would be to construct decorator trees inside root objects that are recursively called by final objects. Many situations could benefit from this solution. Here is a fragment of a cash register, which creates an object whose function is to modify the customer's invoice. There would be a constructor class, which would composite final objects based on runtime state (day of week, actual menu, etc.).
